<h1>Sand&Castle - KC7Cyber SOC Analyst Simulation</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
A SOC Analyst simulation on www.kc7cyber.com.
<br />
<br />
Scenario: <br />
Castle&Sand is a renowned company in the beach accessories and gear industry, operating a vast network of stores across multiple locations. Like all good companies, Castle&Sand collects log data about the activity performed on the corporate network. These security audit logs are stored in Azure Data Explorer (ADX) - a data storage service in Azure (Microsoft’s cloud). You will use the Kusto Query Language (KQL) to parse through various types of security logs. By analysing these logs, you can help us determine whether we’re being targeted by malicious actors.
<br />
<br />
Objectives: <br />
- Use Azure Data Explorer and Kusto Query Language <br />
- Use multiple data sets to answer targeted questions <br />
- Investigate cyber activity in logs including: email, web traffic, and server logs <br />
- Use multiple techniques to track the activity of APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats) <br />
- Use third party data sets to discover things about your attackers <br />
- Make recommendations on what actions a company can take to protect themselves <br />
<br />
